.SH NAME
u-boot-install-sunxi \- install u-boot for sunxi (Allwinner) devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B u-boot-install-sunxi
.RI [ -f ]
.I card-device-or-image-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool installs a u-boot image to the disk (or possibly a disk
image), allowing the machine to boot.  The u-boot image is written to
an area between the partition table and the first partition; there is
no check if it's large enough \(em some ancient fdisk tools used to
reserve only 31KB there, which can result in data loss.
.PP
The device will usually be
.I /dev/mmcblk0
for SD card,
.I /dev/mmcblk1
for eMMC,
.I /dev/sdX
for USB SD card readers (be careful wrt your other disks!).
.PP
By default, the path where
.I .dtb
and
.I .bin
files are copied from is a subdirectory of
.I /usr/lib/u-boot
deduced from the current running system, but if the
.RB $ TARGET
environment variable is set, its contents are used instead.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-f | --force
Skip partition table sanity checks.  Usually, a MBR partition table is
required (so u-boot has something to work with), but in rare setups you
may put the data on another disk.  Likewise, GPT partition tables are
incompatible with the layout used on sunxi devices (spl is written at
offset 16384 while GPT occupies bytes [512..33280) ) but this option lets
you trample upon them anyway.
