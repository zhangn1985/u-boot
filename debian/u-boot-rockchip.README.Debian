== Installation ==

The Firefly-RK3288 u-boot can be installed to microSD:

  dd conv=fsync,notrunc if=/usr/lib/u-boot/firefly-rk3288/u-boot.rksd of=/dev/DEVICE seek=64

Where device is the raw device name of the microSD card or USB to
microSD adapter.

In order to get it to boot from microSD, it may require overwriting
the vendor-supplied u-boot that ships with the board.

See README.rockchip for more information.
