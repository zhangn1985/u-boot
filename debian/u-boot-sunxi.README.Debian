== Installation ==

At this point, you must install U-Boot to flash yourself.

Many sunxi boards (Bananapi, Cubieboard) can be written to SD directly:

 dd conv=fsync,notrunc if=/usr/lib/u-boot/BOARD/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=1024 seek=8

Pine64 plus can be installed using the u-boot-install-sunxi utility.
